          The best customer experience starts with
        <br>    the best call center service provider
        </h2>

        <p class="text-muted1 mb-4">
          SAS is the ultimate customer contact tool. We are able to manage your phone, chat, email, and even text messages when you’re unavailable. Live customer support has no equal when it comes to maximizing profits. And, your customers will love you for it!
        </p>

          <h4 class="fw-medium mb-4 ">
          What call center services does SAS offer?
        </h4>

        <p class="text-muted1 mb-4">
          Call center services are the outsourced solutions we offer as an extension to your own customer support. Either by forwarding your business telephone lines to SAS, routing your overflow traffic to our call center, or by providing your SAS forwarding number to your clients, our call center services allow you to respond to and solve customer issues anytime. When clients call your number, email your office, or text your company, they can speak to a customer service agent in our call center. Your SAS reps will follow your procedures and handle calls just as you would. Outsourcing with us is as simple as it is effortless.
        </p>
        
        <p>Our call center services fall into 2 basic categories: inbound or outbound. Our inbound services focus on the calls we take for your business. This includes things like customer service, help desk support, live chat, and order processing. Our outbound call center services are the calls our operators make for you. This includes things like lead generation, insurance sales, and telemarketing.</p>
        <p>Within the outbound and inbound call center solutions, we also offer 2 types of experiences: dedicated and shared. If you’re looking for a customer experience 100% aligned with your brand, we offer a dedicated call center program where call center agents are hired and trained to work specifically on your account and your account only. Dedicated agents are billed on a per agent basis, not on metered usage.</p>
        <p>If dedicated isn’t in your budget, we have shared inbound call center solutions as well. While these agents aren’t trained by you, each script they follow can be customized so they can follow the same protocols you do in your own office.</p>

         <h4 class="fw-medium mb-4 ">
         24/7 customer service is a game changer.
        </h4>

        <p class="text-muted1 mb-4">
          Great customer service grows businesses. With our live call center at your disposal around the clock, your customers won’t need to bother waiting until tomorrow for the answer they want today. They won’t need to leave you a voicemail after hours wondering if you’ve even received it. It only takes a single phone call and a conversation with a real person to get what they want.
        </p>
    
               <h4 class="fw-medium mb-4 ">
         Never miss another opportunity.
        </h4>

        <p class="text-muted1 mb-4">
          Our call center services give you a chance to capitalize on every customer communication and supercharge your growth by being there anytime and every time your customers have a question, want to schedule an appointment, or are trying to complete a sale. If a customer is ready to reach out, SAS will be ready to represent your business. If it’s a customer who’s ready to buy now, our live call center agents can help turn that single transaction into a lifelong customer. For current customers, you’ll keep them as customers knowing that if they need to speak to a real person, you’ll always be there.
        </p>
    
       <h4 class="fw-medium mb-4 ">
        Affordable customer service outsourcing for any sized business.

        <p class="text-muted1 mb-4">
         Specialty Answering Service is the leading call center in the nation, handling outsourced customer service solutions for over 5,000 businesses around the world. Whether you operate a small mom & pop shop or a large Fortune 500 company, our call center services can help cut down excess costs, increase office productivity, and ultimately help grow your brand.
