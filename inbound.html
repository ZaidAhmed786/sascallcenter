          <strong>What can an inbound call center do?</strong>
        </h4>

        <p class="text-muted1 mb-4">
         An inbound call center can do many of the same business processes as an employee in your own office can do. They handle incoming calls, answer callers’ questions, take messages, dispatch emergencies, schedule appointments and place orders just to name a few. Outsourcing to our call center company to handle these tasks is a cost effective alternative to hiring more in-house staff. With SAS, around the clock live coverage starts at $34/month, which gives you access to have over 300 agents answering your calls – and you don’t have to worry about any overhead costs like insurance and benefits.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-muted1 mb-4">
         Additionally, your inbound call center agents are available 24/7, whereas your in-office staff is usually available 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. No matter what sized business you run, outsourcing to our call center is an efficient, affordable way to increase your customer support, increase office productivity, and strengthen your brand.
        </p>

           <h4 class="fw-light my-3     ">
          <strong>Why outsource to SAS?</strong>
        </h4>

        <p class="text-muted1 mb-4">
        Outsourcing isn’t just about cost savings, it’s about giving your small business the freedom to concentrate on growth rather than worrying about managing the new customer service touch-points that come with expansion. Outsourcing to SAS allows you to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Service your customers 24 hours a day</li>
            <li>Take advantage of difficult-to-achieve security certifications like PCI and HIPAA compliance</li>
            <li>Leverage the experience of a large inbound call center</li>
            <li>Open up new inbound channels like live chat and text response</li>
        </ul>

      </div>
      
      <div class="col-lg-6 mb-4 mb-lg-0 ">
         <h4 class="fw-light my-3     ">
          <strong>Which industries benefit from using an inbound call center service?</strong>
        </h4>

        <p class="text-muted1 mb-4">
        When people think of businesses that are the best candidates for outsourcing, they may think of medical practices and service companies – companies that need 24/7 on-call availability. However, the truth is that all types of businesses can benefit from utilizing a call center. For example, lawyers who are in and out of court all day or meeting with clients can’t always get to the phone. Where the e-commerce space is competitive, 24 hour customer service sets your brand apart from the competition. Utility companies can shine with lower hold times in an industry where hour+ waits are the norm.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-muted1 mb-4">
         Having a live voice answer that initial call can be the deciding factor on whether or not that person wants to hire you or whether or not a customer wants to remain your customer. If your office staff can’t be available every hour of every day, we can.
        </p>

           <h5 class="fw-light my-3     ">
          <strong>We can help every company in every industry</strong>
        </h5>

        <p class="text-muted1 mb-4">
        If you have customers or recognize that great customer service is one of the main factors in the growth of a business, your company can benefit from our inbound call center service. Please check out all of the industries that use call centers to dig deeper into the industry specific inbound call center solutions we’ve developed.

           While some customers will call, more are turning to live chat to engage with a customer support representative. Live chat is great for the customers who want a quick answer, but do not wish to speak to someone over the phone. SAS’s live chat outsourcing service can assist your callers via live chat by answering questions, creating support tickets, scheduling appointments, and more! And, if they want to speak to you, we can answer your phone too.
